# introSE
This is a computer science project that was a semester long for CIS 350 at Grand Valley State University Fall 2015.
During this time we worked together to complete a game concept. Essentially a dungeon crawler in an isometric viewpoint. 
Included in this repository are our code for the project and a downloadable .jar file to execute cross platform.
